# The Random Cat Feeding Game Project
Since I am bored, I created a wholesome minigame using React which requires user to feed random cats on screen. This project calls the cat api from the internet. If you want to have a try, please clone the repository and start it in localhost.

## Technologies and resources
1. ReactJS
2. HTML, CSS, JS
3. Cat API (https://thecatapi.com/)
4. Cat mp3 resources (https://orangefreesounds.com/sound-effects/animal-sounds/cat-meow-sound/)
